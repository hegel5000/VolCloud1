So, I got everything working pretty well, now.

Special features include: axis-aligned cuboids, custom gradients in spheres 
and cuboids, subtractive geometry (works for everything except for the 
pyroclastic puffs), and an arbitrary number of lights in any given picture.

Go into the Release folder to check out the individual config files.  Their
correspnding output images are in the same folder as this file.

Pretty much every demo picture except for void uses subtractive geometry in
some form.  Only shadow_puppet and rusty_cube use subtractive clouds, though.

Every picture uses at least two lights.  shadow_puppet and void use three each.

negasphere uses a cube constrained cloud in order to form the pillar of water.
void also has one, but you can't really see it

puff has a pyroclastic puff.  They're rather hard to use, so I didn't use them
anywhere else.
